    "***\n",
    "This project's goal is to explore movie analytics to provide actionable insights for Microsoft's new Movie Studio. I aim to help aid Microsoft create a baseline structure which will assist them in deciding what factors are important to take into consideration when producing films! \n",
    "\n",
    "I carried out exploratory analyses on datasets containing information about movie titles, ratings, genres, gross income, and directors to create a selection of business models for Microsoft's consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analyses show that movies under the genres Action, Family, and Mystery, on average, have a higher gross box-office income. But, as far as movie ratings go, Drama and Non-Fiction movies tend to, on average, get higher ratings. This tells us that while Action/Family/Mystery movies generally make more money in the box-office, they are not perceived as well by critics.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analyses also explores movie ratings (G, PG, PG-13, R, NR) and the distribution of total movies made through each category, as well as how well, on average, they are perceived by critics. This data shows that R rated movies are made at a much higher rate and on average are rated 'Fresh' on Rotten Tomatoes more often than any other movie rating\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus, I have explored the Top 10 Movie Directors by the number of films they have directed and analyzed their average movie rating. This has shown that Stephen Spielberg has both made the highest number of movies, as well as has the highest average ratings. This tells us that he would be a excellent director to partner with."

    "3. R rated movie based on overall critic response\n",
